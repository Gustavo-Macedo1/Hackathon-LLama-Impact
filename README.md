This project aims to create a low-cost, AI-powered dashboard that synthesizes students' academic performance, school records, and teacher feedback to improve monitoring, early diagnosis, and communication between schools, families, and professionals.

## General Description

- **Project Objective:** Create an innovative low-cost informative dashboard assisted by multi-agent AI, which presents the synthesis, insights and projections of the student's school life, taking into account school life records, the student's academic performance and teachers' comments.


- **Justification:** The school system's documentation is bureaucratic, making it difficult to monitor students' development and identify cognitive problems early. Students' low level of individual information makes it difficult to prevent and treat signs of problems in the school environment. We are looking for a more robust and efficient solution, using a Multi-Agent system based on Llama 3.1, inspired on the context of the Brazilian educational system, aiming to optimize communication between the school, the family and health and education professionals who require the information for diagnostic assessments, distributing relevant and updated information.

- **Target audience for this project:** Users of the education system, education system employees and healthcare professionals who carry out some type of monitoring with students.

 

## Feature Specification
 

    âœ… Easy-to-interpret dashboard, partially generated by Llama 3.1 multi-agent system, interpreting the records of academic performance and a brief description of topics of interest to psycho-pedagogy;

    âœ… Ability to guide, with AI, healthcare and education professionals on how to deal with each occasion through scientific studies;

    âœ… Point out possible cognitive-behavioral or learning disorders, using the data presented and interpreted by AI, generating an alert to be carried out by more adequate professionals.
